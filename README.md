# crafting-interpreters

This repository contains the code I have written while reading the book "Crafting Interpreters". The code is divided into two halves, the first one is `jlox` which contains the java version of the interpreter, to get things going without getting into memory management and performance optimisations. The second is a `c-version` of the same which focuses on doing things fast and right now that I have gotten things working.
