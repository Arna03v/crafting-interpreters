# How does Lox work?
Lox is a scripting language, meaning it executes directly from the source. If you start jlox from the terminal, 
and give to it a file path, it reads the file and executes it.

Fire up jlox without any arguments, and it drops you into a prompt where you can enter and execute code one line at a 
time.
